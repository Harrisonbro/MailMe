Simple javascript bookmarklet to email the current page to yourself. Replace contents of `href` in `bookmarklet.js` with minified javascript function.

No config per se; edit the raw javascript itself to change behaviour. This example uses Mandrill to send the actual email, but the concept would work for any HTTP end-point.
